stack install
if the build fails due to missing SDL you could get libsdl2-gfx-1.0.0    from Synaptic package managerbut that version is old so better to  get the latest stable version and build it yourself:

Linux note: 
<a href="https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php">get SDL version 2.0.8 (stable) source code from here </a>

extract to folder e.g. in home, then ./autogen , ./configure , make
